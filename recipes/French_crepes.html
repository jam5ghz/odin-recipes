        <img src ="../images/crepe.jpeg" alt = "Crepes">
        <p>French crêpes are good for weekend breakfasts, or even for desserts. 
            Serve rolled up and filled with jam or fruit and whipped cream.</p>

        <h2>Ingriedients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Sift flour, sugar, and salt into a bowl; set aside. Beat eggs and milk together in a large bowl with an electric mixer. 
                Beat in flour mixture until smooth; stir in melted butter.</li>
            <li>Lightly grease a griddle or frying pan; heat over medium-high heat.
            </li>
            <li> Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 2 tablespoons for each crêpe. Immediately rotate the skillet to spread batter out in a thin layer. Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Shake the pan or loosen with a spatula; turn or flip it over and cook until other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. 
                Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
